# Web Snippets

This is a collection of HTML, CSS, and Javascript pieces that I've found useful in 
various projects. These aren't plugins, but collections of code that work together,
simplified down to their basic elements for each individual function.

This repository will grow over time to include tricks and behaviours I've found
that I would like to re-use in other projects.

If you have any questions, please let me know! I'm happy to help, and take 
help from others :)
